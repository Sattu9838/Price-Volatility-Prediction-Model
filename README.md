This project demonstrates that combining ARIMA for mean estimation and GARCH for volatility prediction offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable framework for multi-asset forecasting.
Key takeaways:
Mean + volatility forecasts outperform naive models.
Volatility-aware sizing reduces drawdowns.
Modular code enables easy expansion to new assets.
With further enhancements such as cross-asset modeling and nonlinear ML techniques, this framework can evolve into a production-grade trading system suitable for hedge funds, proprietary trading desks, and quantitative research teams.
